# ASP.net Tag Helpers
A demo that shows the built-in tag helpers and how they compare to teh old 4.x Htmlhelpers. We also create a new tag helper that converts Epoch date/timne to human readabledate time.

### Pre-reqs
* Have the default 4.x template with a person scafolded open: https://github.com/martinkearn/DefaultWebFrameworks/tree/master/ASPNet4.5.2/ASPNet452
* Have the default Core 1 template with a person scafolded open: https://github.com/martinkearn/DefaultWebFrameworks/tree/master/ASPNetCoreRC1/ASPNetCoreRC1
* Postman to show the SO API and Epoch time

## Built-in tag helpers
Open the ASP.net core 1 project with the Perosn scafolded (or create it)

Open Views > People > Create.cshtml page

`<form asp-action`
* Example of decortaing existing HTML flags with asp.net functions

`<div asp-validation-summary`
* Choose how the form shoudl be validated

`<label asp-for`

`<input `asp-for`

`<a asp-action`

Open Views > Shared > _Layout.cshtml

* Uses the `environment` environmental variable to differnetaiet where to get CSS. 
* Can be set differently on hosting provider (i.e. azure)
