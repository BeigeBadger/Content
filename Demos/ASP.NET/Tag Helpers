# ASP.net Tag Helpers
A demo that shows the built-in tag helpers and how they compare to teh old 4.x Htmlhelpers. We also create a new tag helper that converts Epoch date/timne to human readabledate time.

### Pre-reqs
* Have the default 4.x template with a person scafolded open: https://github.com/martinkearn/DefaultWebFrameworks/tree/master/ASPNet4.5.2/ASPNet452
* Have the default Core 1 template with a person scafolded open: https://github.com/martinkearn/DefaultWebFrameworks/tree/master/ASPNetCoreRC1/ASPNetCoreRC1
* Postman to show the SO API and Epoch time

## Built-in tag helpers
Open the ASP.net core 1 project with the Person scafolded (or create it)

Open Views > People > Create.cshtml page

`<form asp-action`
* Example of decortaing existing HTML flags with asp.net functions

`<div asp-validation-summary`
* Choose how the form shoudl be validated

`<label asp-for`

`<input `asp-for`

`<a asp-action`

Open Views > Shared > _Layout.cshtml

`<environment>`
* Example of new tag
* Uses the `environment` environmental variable to differnetaiet where to get CSS. 
* Can be set differently on hosting provider (i.e. azure) 

`<link>`
* asp-fallback-href
* asp-append-version

## Compare to 4.x html helpers
Show how we used to do this in 4.x .... by using Htmlhelpers and point out how ugly this is

Open the ASP.net 4.x project with Person scafolded (or create it)

`@using (Html.BeginForm())`

`@Html.LabelFor(model => model.FirstName, htmlAttributes: new { @class = "control-label col-md-2" })`

`@Html.EditorFor(model => model.FirstName, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = "form-control" } })`

`@Html.ActionLink("Back to List", "Index")`
