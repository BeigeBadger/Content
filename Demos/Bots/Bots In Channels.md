# Bots In Channels
This demo aims to show bot in multiple Channels

### Pre Reqs
Get the bot setup as a contact in whichever channel you wish to use:
* Facebook Messenger: Search for it
* Cortana: Make sure you are using the US language (Settings > Cortana Language > English (United States)). Then go to Notebook > Skills and search for Gigseekr
* Delete the contact and conversation from Facebook messenger
* Have a microphone and speaker

## Show Gigseekr in Cortana
_Best to have already shown teh Gigseekr Bot in facebook_

"Hey Cortana, ask Gigseekr to tell me about Pearl Jam UK"

"What type of music do they play"

"Show me their events"

## Monsoon in Bing & Skype
_Monsoon is a vietnamese resturant in Bellevue, Seattle_

Open a private window (so that the bot gives us the new user experience and does not show previous conversations)

Open Bing and search for "Monsoon bellevue"

Click 'Chat'

"tell me about opening hours"

Click 'Parking'

"What is on the menu"

Link to the menu

"Dairy free options?" > It will ask the bsiness and get back to us
