title: Building a serverless blog CMS with Github and Azure
author: Martin Kearn
description: All the articles on Martink.Me are authored on GitHub. I use GitHub API, Webhooks, Azure Functions and an Azure Logic App to get them to end up on my website. I've basically created a Content management System on GitHub. In this article I'll go through how the system is setup and how you can build your own version.
