We all know what an app store is don't we?... we use them to fill our phones and tablets with all those lovely little apps. App stores are our 'go to' place to get the latest functionality for our device.

Also, we all know wha Office is don't we? .... Office is one of Microsoft's oldest products and has been around in some form or another since 1990, that makes it 26 years old. As I write this article. I work with people who are younger than Office and have done for several years!

Office is now available as an 'app' on all sorts of different devices including IOS, Android, Windows store, MAC, Web Browsers and of course the classic Windows desktop.

[More than 1.2 billion people use Microsoft Office](http://news.microsoft.com/bythenumbers/planet-office), by conservative estimates that is around twice as many people than use IOS.

Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook consistently feature in the top 5 productivity apps for IOS and Android devices according to [App Annie](https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/matrix/productivity/?device=ipad&date=2016-01-26)

In short, Office has a staggering user base across all sorts of devices and platforms.

## Did you know that Office has an app store?
Office has had an app store ever since the 2013 suite was released. This app store allows users to install Office add-ins which enhance the capabilities of Office in some way. One of my favourite examples is the Wikipedia app which lets you search for Wikipedia and insert content from Wikipedia directly from within Office.
