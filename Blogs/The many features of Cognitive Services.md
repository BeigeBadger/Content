Microsoft Cognitive Services is a set of 21 REST APIs that enable developers of any platform or language to add machine learning smarts to their applications.

Whilst there are 21 APIs, many of the APIs actually have several different functions related to the main goal of the API.

In this article, I'll provide a very brief overview of each individual function across all of the Cognitive APIs.

## Computer Vision
Extract rich information from images to categorize and process visual dataâ€”and protect your users from unwanted content. 

* **[Analyze an image](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api)**: This feature returns information about visual content found in an image. Use tagging, descriptions and domain-specific models to identify content and label it with confidence. Apply the adult/racy settings to enable automated restriction of adult content. Identify image types and color schemes in pictures. There are two API functions called [POST Analyze Image](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) and [POST Describe Image](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fe)
* **[Recognize celebrities](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api)**: The Celebrity Model is an example of Domain Specific Models. Our new celebrity recognition model recognizes 200K celebrities from business, politics, sports and entertainment around the World. Domain-specific models is a continuously evolving feature within Computer Vision API. There are two API functions called [GET List Domain Specific Models](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fd) and [POST Recognize Domain Specific Content](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e200)
* **[Read text in images](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api)**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) detects text in an image and extracts the recognized words into a machine-readable character stream. Analyze images to detect embedded text, generate character streams and enable searching. Allow users to take photos of text instead of copying to save time and effort. There are two API functions [POST OCR](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) and [POST Tag Image](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1ff)
* **[Generate a thumbnail](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api)**: Generate a high quality storage-efficient thumbnail based on any input image. Use thumbnail generation to modify images to best suit your needs for size, shape and style. Apply smart cropping to generate thumbnails that differ from the aspect ratio of your original image, yet preserve the region of interest. There is a single API function [POST Get Thumbnail](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb)
