# Setting up Gulp from scratch with Visual Studio Code
Gulp is a technology you may have heard of, you may have even played with it a bit. If you are an ASP.net developer, Gulp is about to become very important to the way you build, optimise and package your web projects. If you are not an ASP.NET developer, Gulp is probably already important to the way yo build, optimise and package your web solutions. 

Gulp is one of the more popular of a new(ish) breed of build tools called JavaScript Task Runners. In ASP.NET Core 1.0, Gulp is the default JavaScript Task Runner, though Grunt is also supported by default.

In this article, we'll go through the basic steps of setting Gulp up from scratch using Visual Studio Code. Sure, IDE's like Visual Studio and the default templates in ASP.NET will have an initial configuration out-of-the-box, but to really understand how this stuff works, it is best to build at least one project up from scratch.
