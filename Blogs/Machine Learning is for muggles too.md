# Machine Learning is for Muggles too!
Machine Learning is one of those tech areas which has always seem just slightly out of reach for me. I've always assumes you need a degree in extreme nerdiness from the Boffins university to understand the algorithms and data science that sits behind machine learning. Perhaps you need some kind of magic to get it and those of us born without magic (i.e [muggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle)) should not attempt to enter this world for fear of smashing our face on [platform 9 3/4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station#Harry_Potter) at London Kings Cross station.

I've discovered of late that this is really not the case. Machine Learning is conceptually fairly simple and Microsoft has some great tools in the [Azure Machine Learning service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) and [Project Oxford](https://www.projectoxford.ai/) which makes it accessible to us mere muggles. 

## So what is Machine learning?
The principle of machine learning is actually very simple
